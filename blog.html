            <h3 class="bold text-start">What is a Healthy Diet?</h3>
            <p class="text-dark text-start">Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying
             unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love.
              Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, 
              improving your health, and boosting your mood.
            Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel 
            overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, 
            you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain 
            food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. 
            The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown
             to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern 
             that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to 
             replace processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food
              that is as close as possible to the way nature 
            made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.
            By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn 
            how to create—and stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.

              The Fundamentals of Healthy Eating
            </h2>
              <p class="text-dark">
                While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all
                need a balance of protein, 
                fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals 
                in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don't need to 
                eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, 
                but rather select the healthiest options from each category.
              </p>
            
              <p class="text-dark text-start">
                <strong>Protein</strong> gives you the energy to get up and 
                go—and keep going—whilealso supporting mood and cognitive function.
                Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, 
                but the latest research suggests that many of us need more 
                high-quality protein, especially as we age. That doesn't 
                mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of 
                plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure your 
                body gets all the essential protein it needs.</p>

                        Adequate protein intake supports the development and maintenance of lean muscle mass, which is

                        Amino acids are involved in enzymatic reactions, hormone production,

                In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional
                health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood,

                  Drinking an adequate amount of water is vital for 
                  maintaining proper hydration. Our bodies rely on 
                  water to regulate temperature, transport nutrients, 
                  flush out waste products, and lubricate joints. 
                  Dehydration can lead to a range of health issues, 
                  including fatigue, impaired cognitive function, and

                  Water is essential for digestion and the absorption

                      been linked to a reduced risk of chronic conditions 
                      such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.
